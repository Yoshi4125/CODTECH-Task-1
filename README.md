Overview of the project:
(https://github.com/Yoshi4125/CODTECH-Task-1/assets/172744516/ce6b08b7-ffd8-4992-9bb7-6e01d3781dc9)
Experiment:
           LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
Objective:
         The main objective of this experiment to learn the basics of the microcontroller using the Arduino.
Apparatus:
         Microcontroller of Arduino board
         USB B cable
         LED
         Resistor(1kohm)
         Jumper wires
         Battery Power Source
Working Procedure:
*After completing software installation and coding upload unplug the board.
*Connect output pin number of Arduino board with resistor.
*Connect resistor with positive terminal of LED.
*Connect negative terminal of LED withground pin of Arduino.
*Supply power to Arduino board board by USB B wire or external power port.
Precautions:
*All the connections should be tight and proper.
*Handle the Arduino board carefully.
*Check connections again before program starts to execute.
*Switch of the Arduino board after performing the experiment.
Result:
      After executing the programming the LED connected to the Arduino board will glow when it is high.
